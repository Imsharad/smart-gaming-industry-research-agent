## How Your AI Works: Three Smart Information Sources

Your AI agent is powered by three intelligent information systems that work together seamlessly:

### 1. Your Product Database
**What it does**: Instantly accesses your complete inventory and pricing
**Business value**: Customers get immediate, accurate pricing without calling or visiting
**Example**: *"Customer asks: 'How much is a large parakeet cage?' AI responds instantly with current pricing and suggests accessories."*

### 2. Your Store Knowledge Base
**What it does**: Remembers everything about your store from uploaded documents
**Business value**: Consistent, accurate information about your business 24/7
**Example**: *"Customer asks: 'Are you open on Sundays?' AI provides exact hours and suggests best times to visit for bird selection."*

### 3. Current Bird Care Information
**What it does**: Stays updated with latest bird care research and trends
**Business value**: Positions you as the expert resource customers trust
**Example**: *"Customer asks: 'What's the latest on parrot nutrition?' AI shares current best practices and suggests products you carry."*

## Real Customer Conversations

### Scenario 1: Price Inquiry
```
Customer: "Hi! I'm looking for canary food. What do you have?"

Betty's Bird Brain: "Hello! I'd be happy to help you find canary food. Let me
check our current selection and pricing..."

[Searches product database]

Betty's Bird Brain: "We carry several excellent canary foods:
- Premium Canary Seed Mix (5lb) - $12.99
- Organic Canary Blend (3lb) - $15.49
- Canary Treat Sticks (pack of 6) - $7.99

I'd recommend visiting our store to see the quality difference - our staff can
show you which blend works best for your canary's age and activity level.
We're open until 7pm today!"
```

### Scenario 2: Bird Care Advice
```
Customer: "My parakeet seems to be molting. Is this normal?"

Betty's Bird Brain: "Molting is completely normal for parakeets! Let me share
what's currently recommended for supporting your bird during this time..."

[Searches current bird care information]

Betty's Bird Brain: "Yes, annual molting is healthy and natural. During molting,
parakeets benefit from:
- Higher protein diet (14-16% vs normal 12%)
- Extra vitamin A sources
- Stress reduction

We carry molting support supplements and can recommend the best foods. Our
staff member Sarah is our molting specialist - she has 15 years of experience
with parakeets. Would you like to schedule a visit to discuss your specific
bird's needs?"
```

### Scenario 3: Store Information
```
Customer: "I'm new to the area. Can you tell me about your store?"

Betty's Bird Brain: "Welcome to our community! Betty's Bird Boutique has been
serving local bird lovers since 1987..."

[Searches store knowledge base]

Betty's Bird Brain: "We're a family-owned specialty bird store with over 35
years of experience. Unlike big pet stores, we focus exclusively on birds -
from hand-fed baby birds to expert care advice.

Our current hours are:
- Monday-Friday: 9am-7pm
- Saturday: 9am-6pm
- Sunday: 11am-4pm

We're located at [address] with plenty of parking. Our staff includes certified

to know about any specific type of bird?"
