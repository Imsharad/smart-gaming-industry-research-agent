UdaPlay - AI Game Research Agent (Project 3)
-------------------------------------------
This folder contains a self-contained version of the project structure described in the Udacity brief.

- starter/
  - games/ (15 JSON files with fields: Name, Platform, Genre, Publisher, Description, YearOfRelease)
  - Udaplay_01_solution_project.ipynb  (RAG + ChromaDB indexing + semantic search demo)
  - Udaplay_02_solution_project.ipynb  (stateful UdaPlayAgent with tools + 3 example queries)

NOTE: The games/ data here is mock data matching the expected schema. In the Udacity workspace, you should replace
these JSON files with the official ones provided in starter/games/ before final submission, but the code paths and
field names will remain compatible.
