# Action Items for Next Submission

The code implementation for both the RAG pipeline and the Agent looks excellent. You have correctly implemented the logic, tools, and state management. However, the submission cannot be accepted because the notebooks were not executed.

### Must Fix (Priority Order):

- [ ] **Run Project 1 Notebook**: Open `Udaplay_01_starter_project.ipynb`, execute all cells to populate the vector database, and **save the notebook with the outputs visible**.
- [ ] **Run Project 2 Notebook**: Open `Udaplay_02_starter_project.ipynb`, execute all cells to demonstrate the agent's workflow (Query 1, 2, and 3), and **save the notebook with the outputs visible**.
- [ ] **Verify Outputs**: Before zipping/submitting, double-check that the saved `.ipynb` files actually contain the execution logs (e.g., "Successfully added...", "Answer: ...", "Workflow Analysis...").

### Quick Reference:

| Criterion | Status | File/Location | Issue |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- |
| 1. RAG Pipeline | FAIL | `Udaplay_01_starter_project.ipynb` | Notebook not executed (empty outputs) |
| 2. Agent Tools | FAIL | `Udaplay_02_starter_project.ipynb` | Notebook not executed (empty outputs) |
| 3. Stateful Agent | FAIL | `Udaplay_02_starter_project.ipynb` | Notebook not executed (cannot verify state) |
| 4. Demonstration | FAIL | `Udaplay_02_starter_project.ipynb` | Notebook not executed (no results shown) |

### Estimated Effort: ~15-30 mins
Since the code is already written and appears correct, you mostly need to run the notebooks and ensure your API keys are working. This should be a quick fix!
