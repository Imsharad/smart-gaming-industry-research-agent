please Can you help me review this current student's assignment against the rubric shown here? criteria_prompts/rubric.md

generate feedback/criteria_*.md files based on : /criteria_prompts/prompt.md

<link_verification_checkpoint priority="CRITICAL">
  BEFORE generating each feedback/criteria_{N}.md file:
  - Read external_links.md and locate "## Criterion N" section
  - Extract all available links for that criterion
  - Choose 4-5 most relevant links from ONLY that list
  - Copy URLs exactly as written in external_links.md
  - FORBIDDEN: Using any link not listed in external_links.md
</link_verification_checkpoint>

<image_inclusion_checkpoint priority="CRITICAL">
  MANDATORY STEP: BEFORE generating each feedback/criteria_{N}.md file:
  - Read criteria{N}.md file completely
  - Locate the section that says "Paste these EXACT external Image URLs AS IT IS :"
  - Copy ALL image markdown syntax EXACTLY as written
  - Include ALL images in feedback/criteria_{N}.md file
  - Place images in contextually appropriate sections
  - NEVER skip image inclusion - this is mandatory for every feedback file
  - FORBIDDEN: Modifying image URLs or markdown syntax
  - FORBIDDEN: Omitting any images specified in criteria{N}.md
</image_inclusion_checkpoint>

First read one criteria{N}.md file followed by generating the feedback/criteria_{N}.md file
so on
