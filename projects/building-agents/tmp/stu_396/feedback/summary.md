# Project Evaluation Summary

**Result: PASS**

Congratulations on completing the "Building Agents" project! You have successfully demonstrated the ability to architect, build, and evaluate a complex AI agent from the ground up.

## Highlights of Your Submission

- **Robust Knowledge Base:** You correctly implemented the RAG pipeline, ensuring that your agent has a solid foundation of internal knowledge stored in ChromaDB.
- **Adaptive Reasoning:** Your agent's ability to switch between internal retrieval and web search tools based on the query's context is a critical feature for real-world applications.
- **Sophisticated State Management:** By implementing a custom state machine with typed state, you've built a system that can handle the complexity of multi-turn conversations without losing context.
- **Data-Driven Evaluation:** Using an evaluator to generate reports on your agent's performance sets a high standard for quality assurance.

## Next Steps

You have a solid framework in place. As you continue your journey, consider exploring:
- **Advanced Retrieval:** Implementing "hybrid search" (combining keyword and semantic search) to improve retrieval accuracy.
- **Latency Optimization:** Experimenting with different embedding models or chunking strategies to see how they affect speed and cost.
- **LangGraph Adoption:** Refactoring your custom state machine into LangGraph to leverage its built-in features for cyclic graphs and human-in-the-loop workflows.

Excellent work! You are now ready to tackle even more advanced challenges in the world of Agentic AI.
