# Action Items for Next Submission

It appears you have submitted an "Email Assistant" project instead of the required "Udaplay" Video Game RAG project. While your work on the Email Assistant shows good understanding of LangGraph, you must complete the specific assignment requirements to pass.

## Must Fix (Priority Order):

- [ ] **Criterion 1 (RAG Pipeline)**: Locate the "Udaplay" starter files and the `games` dataset. Implement the data loading and ChromaDB ingestion pipeline in `Udaplay_01_solution_project.ipynb`.
- [ ] **Criterion 2 (Agent Tools)**: Create the specific tools required: `retrieve_game_data`, `evaluate_relevance`, and a web search fallback (e.g., Tavily).
- [ ] **Criterion 3 (Stateful Agent)**: Adapt your `StateGraph` logic to manage conversation history for *video game* queries (not emails) and ensure sources are cited.
- [ ] **Criterion 4 (Demonstration)**: Submit `Udaplay_02_solution_project.ipynb` showing the agent answering at least 3 specific questions about video games, with visible reasoning traces.

## Quick Reference:

| Criterion | Status | File/Location                              |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | FAIL   | `Udaplay_01_solution_project.ipynb` (Missing) |
| 2         | FAIL   | Agent Tools (Incorrect domain) |
| 3         | FAIL   | State Management (Incorrect domain) |
| 4         | FAIL   | `Udaplay_02_solution_project.ipynb` (Missing) |

## Estimated Effort: Significant rework (Full Project Implementation)
You will need to implement the correct project from scratch or locate your work if you simply uploaded the wrong folder.
