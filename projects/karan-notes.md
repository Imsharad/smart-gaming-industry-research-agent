what review ops check for :

FAIL = one line summaru should always exist why it failed, how it failed, what can be improved

it should also include without any

One line should always exist for what you like

future learning should be addressed using external links

depth in main review page extremely geared towards the FAILED

EXTERNAL links should be context

why they are placed in the criteria feedback

what about fake submissions?

When failing a submission:

- Always include a concise, one-line summary covering all issues that need to be addressed in the next submission.
- Highlight at least one area of the submission that you genuinely appreciated.
- Add an inspiring suggestion for future learning—ideally with a relevant external resource or link (ensure links are contextual, not just a generic list).
- These are the foundational standards for an effective opening note.

Opening notes should always balance positive feedback with constructive areas for improvement.

ReviewOps checks for:

- Sufficient detail in your feedback. All rubric sections should be addressed, with good, descriptive comments in at least 50% of rubric sections (base expectation). More is always better.
- Especially for failed rubric items, you must clearly explain:
- What failed,
- Why it failed,
- How it can be improved.
- Detailed feedback is critical for failed rubrics, especially in the main review page.

For code reviews specifically:

- At least 4 or 5 specific, personalized comments are expected (avoid repeating boilerplate, and don’t simply provide “laundry lists” of resources).
- Ensure your feedback is tailored to the submission, not copied between reviews.

Scoring and feedback:

- ReviewOps score is automated and based on the quality and detail of your reviews.
- This is complemented by the student feedback score, which is also weighted at 50%. The student score helps balance out extremes and is a key indicator from the stakeholder perspective.
- Student feedback is broken down into five categories (visible in the review API), and both scores combine to form your Mentor Quality Score (MQS).

Minimum requirements for score calculation:

- At least 30 submissions for the ReviewOps score to generate.
- At least 20 student feedback reviews (ideally 10 passed, 10 failed) for the student feedback score.

Previously, monthly leveling emails ranked mentors between levels 1, 2, and 3, but that practice has been paused recently due to process challenges.

Additional:

- When grading a failed submission, avoid fluff and be direct in communicating what needs to improve.
- For reviews of agents, trip planners, and tools:
- Pay particular attention to rubric gaps in “agents” and “trip planner” sections.
- Ensure clarity and quality of external links and opening notes.
- External links are fine in “udaplay,” but the opening note quality needs improvement.
- For “energy advisor” and “fintool,” focus on crafting better opening notes.
- For “knowledge agents,” provide more external agents/resources and improve the opening.
- The overall goal is to remove fluff, be direct, and continually increase the clarity and value of your feedback.

  - At least 50% of rubric sections must have good, descriptive comments as a base expectation.
  - More detailed and personalized comments are better.
- It's important to explain in detail what has failed, why it failed, and how to improve, especially for failed rubrics.
- For code reviews:

  - At least 4-5 specific comments are expected.
  - Avoid generic laundry lists of resources; feedback should be personalized, not boilerplate.
- Scoring is based on two parts:

  - ReviewOps automated score, based on quality and detail in reviews.
  - Student feedback score, balancing out extremes in student responses.
  - Both scores have 50% weightage each.
  - Student feedback comprises five categories as seen in the review API.
- Minimum requirements for score calculation:

  - At least 30 submissions for ReviewOps to generate a score.
  - At least 20 (ideally 10 passed, 10 failed) for Student Feedback score to be generated.
- The two scores combine to form the MQS (Mentor Quality Score).

Many years was that I get to know my performance when I receive an email the next month, why can't I have a real-time thing to monitor performance? Right. Very legit concern, right. But unfortunately we never got product support to build it internally. Right. So we actually last, the template feature you are that template feature Sagar and I originally made outside of a product, we had made a Chrome extension for reviewers. So when we built that extension, we took the liberty of showing everyone's score real time. Yeah, right. But then what happened was Accenture's buyout, due to security reasons, had to discontinue it. Now a good thing happened that its utilization was so great that the product team had to incorporate that feature in the reviews interface before sunsetting the… so the template feature got incorporated but with the change we lost the feature to show scores. So as a stop gap what I did was I set up this automation which sends

FAILED SUBMISSIONS :

when you are grading a failed submission fluff needs to be removed

intiallly you need to be DIRECT

I am telling you from 15th October to yesterday and I'm giving you feedback in order of volume that you have done. So in agentsville trip planner review_opscore has a lot of scope for improvement. The aspects are external links/opening statement in udaply external links are doing well, but there is little more space where you can do even better, so I guess your recent ones are doing well, and the numbers of the ones that were done before are impacting. But even in this opening statement is not doing well, there is a lot of space in opening statement. Energy advisor, sirf opening statement mein improvement ki zweraht hai. Building agents project autonomous knowledge agent usne external links again is doing fair, but there can be some more space to improve the numbers like some more gap you can fill there. Opening statement is doing worse than out of all four that we have spoken. Delhi main bhot kaha ho isme building agents no sorry for which one opening kahe pe sabse kharabe? Building agents project autonomous knowledge agent mein fin tool analyst me opening statement again requires improvement. Swift card is doing well, audacity sense is doing well. Okay, so basically overall theme mujhe lagri opening sentence needs to be nailed down across the reviews. Yes, opening statement mein aapko thoda taam karna padega. If you need you can try some elements and then you can send me screenshots. I can give you some feedback. Also, past ka apka updated statement kaise lag raha hai aur fail ka kaise lag raha hai. I can let you know as far as student feedback is concerned. I don't know yeh purane markings hai ya kya hai, but agents will mein what I see is clarity, details, personalization, and usefulness. There is space in all of them to improve. Okay, so here is a small tip here. Agar details, usefulness when you are grading a failed rubric right just get straight to the point as soon as you can. This is failed because of whatever reason, and this is how you can look to improve or like don't do fluff for failed ones. Because scrolling ka adat hai naa? To past wala to koi dekhta nahi hai, but fail ka ho hai wahan pe pehle jaa ke. And there your student does not want to read fluff. So two things like pehle maine apko bola ki failed ones mein thoda details ka dhyana rakhna, but at the same time now I'm also telling you ki failed ones mein don't start with a lot of intro or fluff. Just get to the point initially, phir uske baad niche aapko thoda baut kuch add rakhna hai. To that's just something that worked well for me personally. Abhi ke reviewers ke apne styles hain, but mere liye to o bohat kaam kar gaya. Yudaply mein it's the same trend - usefulness, details, personalization, sab mein scores hai, but just a lot of room to push the numbers to do better. So ye 4.5 wala jo aap dekh rahe ho, I guess that will be your recent scores, yaa may be aesa hoga ki aapko you can go back to reviews API and check are you getting all good scores on one outcome. Sab past pe apko acche ratings aa rahe hain kya? Failed pe aap mark ha rahe ho gaya? Because that's usually what happens most reviewers right they wonder ki kya ho raha hai, but what they fail to catch is ki past pe sab accha ha raha hai aur failed pe mark ha raha hai aur score dono ko equal weightage ditaa toh aapka may
