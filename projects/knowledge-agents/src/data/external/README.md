# External Data

This directory holds data related to external accounts that UDA-Hub integrates with. For this project, it contains the data for the first customer, CultPass.

Files include:
- `cultpass.db`: An SQLite database with customer data, including users, subscriptions, and reservations.
- `cultpass_articles.jsonl`: The raw knowledge base articles provided by CultPass, which are loaded into the core `udahub.db`.
- Other `.jsonl` files containing user and experience data.

These files simulate the data provided by an external client system.
