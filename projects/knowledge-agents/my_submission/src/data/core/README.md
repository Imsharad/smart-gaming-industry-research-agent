# Core Data

This directory contains the core database for the UDA-Hub application, `udahub.db`.

This SQLite database stores all internal data required for the agentic system to operate, including:
- The knowledge base of support articles.
- Tables for the memory system, such as customer interaction history and preferences.
- Structured logs for agent decisions and workflow tracking.

It is the central data store for the UDA-Hub's own information and operational data, as distinct from the external customer data.
