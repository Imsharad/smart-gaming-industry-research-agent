    <introduction>
        <scenario>You’ve joined a fast-growing AI startup building the next frontier in customer support automation.</scenario>
        <problem_statement>Your team is responsible for building UDA-Hub, a Universal Decision Agent designed to plug into existing customer support systems (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, internal CRMs) and intelligently resolve tickets. But this isn’t just another FAQ bot.</problem_statement>
        <goal>
            <summary>Build an agentic system that reads, reasons, routes, and resolves, acting as the operational brain behind support teams.</summary>
            <responsibilities>
                <responsibility>Understand customer tickets across channels</responsibility>
                <responsibility>Decide which agent or tool should handle each case</responsibility>
                <responsibility>Retrieve or infer answers when possible</responsibility>
                <responsibility>Escalate or summarize issues when necessary</responsibility>
                <responsibility>Learn from interactions by updating long-term memory</responsibility>
            </responsibilities>
            <motto>Your agent should not only automate, it should decide how to automate!</motto>

        <title>Project Introduction</title>
        <description>In this project, you will develop UDA-Hub, an intelligent, multi-agent decision suite capable of resolving customer support tickets across multiple platforms.</description>

        <key_capabilities>
            <capability name="Multi-Agent Architecture with LangGraph">Design and orchestrate specialized agents (e.g., Supervisor, Classifier, Resolver, Escalation…).</capability>
            <capability name="Input Handling">Accept incoming support tickets in natural language with metadata (e.g., platform, urgency, history).</capability>
            <capability name="Decision Routing and Resolution">
                <sub_capability>Route tickets to the right agent based on classification</sub_capability>
                <sub_capability>Retrieve relevant knowledge via RAG if needed</sub_capability>
                <sub_capability>Resolve or escalate based on confidence and context</sub_capability>
            </capability>
            <capability name="Memory Integration">
                <sub_capability>Maintain state during steps of the execution</sub_capability>
                <sub_capability>Short-term memory is used as context to keep conversation running during the same session</sub_capability>
                <sub_capability>Store and recall long-term memory for preferences, as an example</sub_capability>
            </capability>
        </key_capabilities>

    <instructions>
        <starter_code>
            <description>Your starter folder looks like the following structure:</description>
            <code>
starter/
├── agentic/
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── design/
│   ├── tools/
│   └── workflow.py
├── data/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── external/
│   └── models/
├── .env
├── 01_external_db_setup.ipynb
├── 02_core_db_setup.ipynb
├── 03_agentic_app.ipynb
└── utils.py
            </code>
        </starter_code>

        <section name="Design">
            <instruction>Start by designing the solution. Your implementation will follow it.</instruction>
            <instruction>Place all the documentation and diagrams about the design of your agentic system inside agentic/design</instruction>
        </section>

        <section name="Setup">
            <instruction>Run notebook 01_external_db_setup.ipynb in order to have all the data related to the account Cultpass. It's the first customer that has purchased Uda-hub</instruction>
            <instruction>Run notebook 02_core_db_setup.ipynb in order to have all the data related to Uda-hub application, including the files "received" from Cultpass like cultpass_articles.jsonl</instruction>
            <instruction>You need to expand cultpass_articles form 4 to at least14 articles. Make sure you have diverse topics for your agentic system.</instruction>
        </section>

        <section name="Agentic Workflow">
            <instruction>Develop your agents inside agentic/agents and your tools inside agentic/tools . This will help you with modularity.</instruction>
            <instruction>Develop your workflow orchestration in the file workflow.py . There's already a sample for you, but do not use it, create the graph from scratch. Do not use the prebuilt please.</instruction>
            <instruction>When developing tools that abstract the database both for retrieval or for actions, please mind the relative/absolute paths. I strongly recommend you to use something like MCP servers for the tools.</instruction>
            <instruction>If you're using RAG for retrieval, make sure you have documented how it works.</instruction>
            <instruction>For short-term memory (session), you can use thread_id. For long-term memory, you're free to use semantic search.</instruction>
        </section>

        <section name="Run">
            <instruction>There's a chat_interface() function inside utils.py. It's just a simple while True block. Starter code imports this inside the notebook. Feel free to improve it!</instruction>
            <instruction>You're not forced to use 03_agentic_app.ipynb , you can develop inside a .py module, but please name it as 03_agentic_app.py and make it explicit how to run your project.</instruction>
            <instruction>You must need to create test cases to meet the Rubric!</instruction>
        </section>

        <section name="Submission Instructions">
            <instruction>As mentioned above, you're receiving the starter code, but please submit your project with all artifacts under solution/ . We'll not look into starter/ . Make sure you are copying and pasting the code from starter/ to solution/ if you're not modifying it.</instruction>
            <instruction>If you have installed a package, share the name and version in the documentation. Ideally share your requirements.txt and Python version, If you're developing locally.</instruction>
        </section>
